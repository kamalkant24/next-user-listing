# User List Page with Next.js 15

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple **User List Page** using **Next.js 15** (Stable version) with **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**. The page displays a list of users and their short descriptions, optimizes for **SEO**, and complies with **WCAG** accessibility standards.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Used for SEO optimization
- **SEO Optimization**: Dynamic `<title>` and `<meta>` tags
- **WCAG Compliance**: Accessible HTML structure, focus states, alt text for images
- **Performance**: Optimized images, lazy loading, SSR

## Features

- **SSR for SEO**: The page is rendered on the server for faster indexing by search engines.
- **Dynamic Metadata**: The page includes a dynamic title and meta description for each route.
- **WCAG Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, alt text for images.
- **User List**: Displays static user data (name and short description) loaded from a JSON file.
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast load times using lazy-loaded images and server-side rendering.

## SEO Optimization

The project includes the following SEO optimizations:

- **Dynamic `<title>` and `<meta description>` tags**: Set for each page to improve visibility in search engines.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Ensures the page content is crawlable by search engines.

## Sitemap and robots.txt
## Sitemap Generation
To ensure search engines can easily find and index all pages of your website, a sitemap.xml file is generated dynamically and placed in the public/ directory.

Sitemap URL: https://next-user-listing-iota.vercel.app/sitemap.xml

Next.js Integration: The next-sitemap package is used to automatically generate the sitemap during the build process.

## robots.txt Generation
The robots.txt file is automatically generated by next-sitemap and is served at:

robots.txt URL: https://next-user-listing-iota.vercel.app/robots.txt

The robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which pages should or should not be indexed. This file is automatically generated when using next-sitemap.

## WCAG Compliance

To meet the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**, the project includes:

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of HTML5 elements like `<h1>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Implemented basic focus states for accessibility via keyboard.
- **Alt Text for Images**: Descriptive alt text added for images to improve screen reader accessibility.

## Performance Optimization

- **Optimized Image Loading**: Images are lazy-loaded using Next.js's `<Image>` component, ensuring faster load times.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: The page is pre-rendered on the server, making the initial page load faster for users.
